This post demonstrates all typography elements and how they appear with our custom styling. Use this as a reference for writing well-formatted blog posts.

## Heading Level 2

This is how a second-level heading appears. It's perfect for major sections in your post.

### Heading Level 3

Third-level headings are great for subsections within a major topic.

#### Heading Level 4

Fourth-level headings work well for specific points or examples.

##### Heading Level 5

Fifth-level headings are useful for minor subsections.

###### Heading Level 6

Sixth-level headings are the smallest and rarely used.

## Text Formatting

This is a regular paragraph with **bold text** and *italic text*. You can also use ***bold and italic*** together. Here's some `inline code` within a sentence.

This is another paragraph demonstrating line spacing. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. Ut enim ad minim veniam, quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris.

## Lists

### Unordered Lists

- First item in the list
- Second item with more text to show wrapping behavior when the content is longer than one line
- Third item with nested lists:
  - Nested item one
  - Nested item two
    - Deep nested item
    - Another deep nested item
  - Back to second level
- Fourth item back at the top level

### Ordered Lists

1. First step in the process
2. Second step with detailed explanation that spans multiple lines to demonstrate text wrapping
3. Third step with sub-steps:
   1. Sub-step A
   2. Sub-step B
   3. Sub-step C
4. Fourth and final step

### Mixed Lists

1. Ordered item one
   - Unordered sub-item
   - Another unordered sub-item
2. Ordered item two
   - Sub-point A
   - Sub-point B
     1. Numbered sub-sub-point
     2. Another numbered sub-sub-point

## Code Blocks

### JavaScript Example

```javascript
// Function to calculate fibonacci sequence
function fibonacci(n) {
  if (n <= 1) return n;
  
  const sequence = [0, 1];
  for (let i = 2; i <= n; i++) {
    sequence[i] = sequence[i - 1] + sequence[i - 2];
  }
  
  return sequence[n];
}

console.log(fibonacci(10)); // Output: 55
```

### Go Example

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "net/http"
)

func main() {
    http.HandleFunc("/", func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
        fmt.Fprintf(w, "Hello, World!")
    })
    
    fmt.Println("Server starting on :8080")
    http.ListenAndServe(":8080", nil)
}
```

### Shell Commands

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run development server
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build
```

## Blockquotes

> This is a blockquote. It's perfect for highlighting important information or quotes from other sources.
> 
> Blockquotes can span multiple paragraphs. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.

Here's a nested blockquote:

> This is the outer quote
> > And this is nested inside
> > > Even deeper nesting is possible
> 
> Back to the main quote level

## Links

Here are different types of links:

- [External link to GitHub](https://github.com)
- [Internal link to home page](/)
- [Link to blog listing](/blog)
- Automatic link: https://example.com
- [Link with title](https://google.com "Google Search")

## Images

Images are styled with rounded corners and shadows:

## Tables

### Simple Table

| Column 1 | Column 2 | Column 3 |
|----------|----------|----------|
| Data 1   | Data 2   | Data 3   |
| Data 4   | Data 5   | Data 6   |
| Data 7   | Data 8   | Data 9   |

### Complex Table with Alignment

| Left Aligned | Center Aligned | Right Aligned | Description |
|:-------------|:--------------:|--------------:|-------------|
| Row 1 Col 1  | Row 1 Col 2    | Row 1 Col 3   | This is a longer description |
| A            | B              | C             | Short desc |
| Lorem ipsum  | Dolor sit      | Amet          | Consectetur adipiscing elit |

## Horizontal Rules

Text before the horizontal rule.

---

Text after the horizontal rule. These are useful for separating major sections.

---

Another section after another horizontal rule.

## Definition Lists

While not standard Markdown, here's how terms might appear:

**API (Application Programming Interface)**
: A set of rules and protocols for building software applications.

**REST (Representational State Transfer)**
: An architectural style for designing networked applications.

**GraphQL**
: A query language for APIs and a runtime for executing those queries.

## Special Characters & Symbols

You can use various special characters:

- Copyright: ¬© 2025
- Trademark: ‚Ñ¢
- Registered: ¬Æ
- Arrows: ‚Üí ‚Üê ‚Üë ‚Üì ‚áí ‚áê
- Math: ¬± √ó √∑ ‚âà ‚â† ‚â§ ‚â•
- Emoji: üöÄ üíª ‚ö° ‚ú® üéØ

## Inline HTML

Sometimes you need <mark>highlighted text</mark> or <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>C</kbd> keyboard shortcuts.

You can also use <small>small text</small> or <sup>superscript</sup> and <sub>subscript</sub>.

## Long Code Lines

```python
# This is a very long line of code that should demonstrate horizontal scrolling in code blocks when the content exceeds the container width
def very_long_function_name_with_many_parameters(parameter1, parameter2, parameter3, parameter4, parameter5, parameter6, parameter7):
    return f"Processing: {parameter1}, {parameter2}, {parameter3}, {parameter4}, {parameter5}, {parameter6}, {parameter7}"
```

## Combining Elements

Here's a complex example combining multiple elements:

### Project Setup Guide

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/username/repo.git
   cd repo
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   - Run `npm install` for Node packages
   - Configure your `.env` file:
     ```env
     DATABASE_URL=postgresql://localhost/mydb
     API_KEY=your-api-key-here
     ```

3. **Start development**
   > **Note:** Make sure you have Node.js 18+ installed
   
   Run the following command:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. **Access the application**
   - Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
   - Login with default credentials:
     - Username: `admin`
     - Password: `password123`

### Common Issues

| Problem | Solution | Notes |
|---------|----------|-------|
| Port already in use | Change port in `.env` | Use `PORT=3001` |
| Database connection failed | Check PostgreSQL service | Run `psql` to verify |
| Module not found | Clear cache and reinstall | `rm -rf node_modules && npm install` |
