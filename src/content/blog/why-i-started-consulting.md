Consulting pays less than you think.

But I knew I wouldn't go back to just full-time employment. Here's why.

## Why I Started

Simple. I wanted to solve problems, not attend meetings about solving problems.

Here's what pushed me over the edge.

Most companies face the same technical challenges. Scaling issues. Architecture decisions. Team dynamics. But each company thinks their problems are unique. They aren't.

The pattern became clear. Companies need deep technical expertise for critical decisions. But not every day. Maybe few times a quarter. Rest of the time? Process and politics.

As a consultant, I focus on those critical moments. The architecture reviews. The scaling strategies. The build vs buy decisions.

No daily standups. No performance reviews. Just technical problem-solving.

## The Economics

Let's be honest about money.

Companies save on full-time senior tech salaries. They get expertise when needed. No benefits, no equity, no long-term commitments.

Consultants charge premium hourly rates. But work fewer total hours. It balances out.

Everyone wins when the model fits.

## The Reality Check

**What's working:**

- Direct impact on technical decisions
- No corporate politics
- Variety of problems keeps things interesting
- Flexibility in choosing projects

**What's hard:**

- No team to build
- No long-term product ownership
- Income variability
- You're always the outsider

## The Unexpected Part

The best part? Brutal honesty.

When you're not angling for promotion or protecting your job, you can say what needs saying. "This architecture won't scale." "You're solving the wrong problem." "That vendor is ripping you off."

Companies actually pay for this honesty. Wild.

## Four Months Later

Am I making less than a full-time role? Some months.

Am I working on more interesting problems? Every single day.

Do I miss having a team? Sometimes.

Would I go back? Not a chance.

The thing about consulting is this: you're selling expertise, not time. And expertise compounds across clients.

Every problem I solve for one client makes me better for the next. Every pattern I recognize saves someone else months of mistakes.

That's the real value. Not the hourly rate. The patterns.
