Microservices architecture has revolutionized how we build scalable applications. Let's explore the key patterns that make this approach successful.

## The Circuit Breaker Pattern

The circuit breaker pattern prevents cascading failures in distributed systems. Here's a simple implementation:

```javascript
class CircuitBreaker {
    constructor(threshold = 5, timeout = 60000) {
        this.threshold = threshold;
        this.timeout = timeout;
        this.failureCount = 0;
        this.state = "CLOSED";
        this.nextAttempt = Date.now();
    }

    async call(asyncFunction) {
        if (this.state === "OPEN") {
            if (Date.now() > this.nextAttempt) {
                this.state = "HALF_OPEN";
            } else {
                throw new Error("Circuit breaker is OPEN");
            }
        }

        try {
            const result = await asyncFunction();
            this.onSuccess();
            return result;
        } catch (error) {
            this.onFailure();
            throw error;
        }
    }

    onSuccess() {
        this.failureCount = 0;
        this.state = "CLOSED";
    }

    onFailure() {
        this.failureCount++;
        if (this.failureCount >= this.threshold) {
            this.state = "OPEN";
            this.nextAttempt = Date.now() + this.timeout;
        }
    }
}
```

## Service Discovery Mechanisms

In a microservices ecosystem, services need to find each other dynamically. Here are the main approaches:

### Client-Side Discovery

- Services register with a service registry
- Clients query the registry and choose an instance
- More complex client logic but better performance

### Server-Side Discovery

- Load balancer handles service discovery
- Simpler client implementation
- Additional network hop

## API Gateway Pattern

An API Gateway acts as a single entry point for all client requests:

```yaml
# Example Kong API Gateway configuration
services:
    - name: user-service
      url: http://user-service:8080
      routes:
          - name: user-route
            paths:
                - /api/users
            methods:
                - GET
                - POST
                - PUT
                - DELETE
      plugins:
          - name: rate-limiting
            config:
                minute: 100
                hour: 10000
```

## Event Sourcing Architecture

Event sourcing stores the state of a business entity as a sequence of state-changing events:

```python
class EventStore:
    def __init__(self):
        self.events = []
        self.snapshots = {}

    def append_event(self, event):
        self.events.append({
            'id': str(uuid.uuid4()),
            'timestamp': datetime.now(),
            'type': event.__class__.__name__,
            'data': event.to_dict()
        })

    def get_events(self, aggregate_id, from_version=0):
        return [e for e in self.events
                if e['aggregate_id'] == aggregate_id
                and e['version'] > from_version]

    def create_snapshot(self, aggregate_id, state, version):
        self.snapshots[aggregate_id] = {
            'state': state,
            'version': version,
            'timestamp': datetime.now()
        }
```

## Saga Pattern for Distributed Transactions

The Saga pattern manages transactions that span multiple services:

![Saga Pattern Diagram](https://example.com/saga-pattern.png)

### Choreography-Based Saga

Each service produces and listens to events:

```go
type OrderSaga struct {
    OrderID     string
    Status      string
    CompletedSteps []string
}

func (s *OrderSaga) Execute() error {
    steps := []func() error{
        s.createOrder,
        s.reserveInventory,
        s.processPayment,
        s.shipOrder,
    }

    for i, step := range steps {
        if err := step(); err != nil {
            // Compensate by running previous steps in reverse
            s.compensate(i - 1)
            return err
        }
        s.CompletedSteps = append(s.CompletedSteps, fmt.Sprintf("Step%d", i))
    }

    return nil
}
```

| Service Mesh   | Low     | Very High  | High       | Internal communication   |
| Event Sourcing | High    | Medium     | High       | Audit trails             |
| CQRS           | Low     | High       | Medium     | Read-heavy workloads     |
| Saga           | Medium  | Medium     | High       | Distributed transactions |

## Best Practices Checklist

- [ ] Implement health checks for all services
- [ ] Use correlation IDs for distributed tracing
- [ ] Set up circuit breakers for external calls
- [ ] Define clear service boundaries
- [ ] Implement idempotent operations
- [ ] Use async communication where possible
- [ ] Monitor service dependencies
- [ ] Implement proper retry logic with exponential backoff

## Conclusion

Microservices patterns provide powerful tools for building resilient, scalable systems. Choose patterns based on your specific requirements and gradually adopt them as your system grows.
